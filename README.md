# Car Sharing - my very first small webpage

This is my first ever project made with HTML and CSS. I did it in November of 2019 during **Coderslab workshop** using only **HTML and CSS**.

## The project's main goal

My teacher gave me layout.jpg file with the idea how the webpage should look. My task was to recreate this layout using freshly learnt HTML and CSS and assets from images folder.

In this project I also practised:

- implementing Google Fonts;
- connecting HTML file to CSS stylesheet;
- using CSS Reset file;
- using lists, background image, flexbox;
- basic CSS tags;

## Sources

I got layout.jpg file. You can find it in images folder.

## Installation

Just download all the files, and open index.html
